## Method

Egusi (Ground melon seed which is not the same as pumpkin seed) can be cooked in different methods.

Frying method: In this method you fry ground melon seed paste in palm oil first before adding the other ingredients.

Boiling method: this does not require any frying, i prefer this method as it is acclaimed to be healthier and thats the mthod used in this recipe.

Rinse the vegetables and leave to drain in the colander. If you would be using frozen vegetables, allow thawing before using. Squeeze out excess water and set aside.

In a blender, add red bell pepper, scotch bonnet chillies and onions with little water and blend till smooth. Empty into a bowl and set aside (you can blend the locust beans with the pepper if you want)

Add washed meat to another pot, add salt seasoning and chopped onions and bring to boil till tender, reserve stock for the soup.

Mix the ground melon with warm water to form a paste and set aside

Place a pot on a medium heat, add the meat stock and palm oil and bring to boil for about 5 to 10 minutes

Add the melon paste to the pot in bits and stir into the stock/palm oil mixture and stir gently to combine. Add the locust beans, add more water if need be and continue to cook for another 10-15 minutes making sure you stir intermittently till well cooked and almost lump free. Add the blended pepper and cook for another 5-8 minutes. Add crayfish, the meat, seasoning and salt 

Add half of the smoked fish to the egusi soup and stir to combine and cook for another 5 minutes

Add the waterleaf to the egusi and stir to combine, add the remaining smoked fish and carefully stir into the soup and cook for another 5 minutes. Take it off the heat and Viola!!! "soup is ready" serve with swallow of choice or rice.



## Tips

Please be careful when adding salt to soup that contains stock as you might not be needing salt if the stock was well seasoned.

Melon soup is usually not thick, so add more water or stock to the soup to make it light if need be.
