# Argentinian Chimichurri

One of the indispensable sides of traditional grilling in Argentina is a good chimichurri sauce. Although there are many variations on how to create one, this recipe focuses on the basics that everyone seems to agree with. Chimichurri goes excellent with steak, but you can also have it with bread, salad, potatoes, and anything else that can benefit from its potent flavor.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup of finely chopped parsley
- 1/4 cup dried oregano
- 1/2 cup of canola oil
- 1 teaspoon of vinegar (red is preferred, but white is OK)
- 1 teaspoon of garlic, extremely finely chopped or pureed
- Salt to taste, start with about 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt

## Tools

- Mixing bowl

## Method

This is all about mixing. Get all the ingredients, but save salt to last. Since you add salt to your taste, it is easier to go bit by bit at the end. Make sure to mix everything very well with a spoon.

## Tips

There are multiple variations of this base recipe. But resist the temptation of adding horrors like cilantro or basil. These don't have a place in the basic chimichurri. However, other extras or substitutions are fine and don't deviate much from this sauce's true origins. Feel free to use any of these:

- Substitute canola oil with olive oil
- Skip the garlic
- Add a teaspoon of crushed red pepper
- Add 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper

The chimichurri will last you for 3 or 4 days before the taste starts to deteriorate. The day after tastes the best!
