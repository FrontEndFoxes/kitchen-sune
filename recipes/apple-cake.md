## Method

Turn on the oven to preheat to a temperature of 180 degree (or 160 deg. fan)

Add sugar, margarine and self raising flour into a bowl and rub ingredients together with your finger tips

Peel and core your apples and dispose of them. Then dice the apples into small pieces. 

Add the diced apples, egg and milk to the bowl and mix until doughy 

Put baking paper or rub margarine around baking tray and add mixture to the tray and sprinkle with sugar
