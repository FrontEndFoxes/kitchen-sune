# Banana Oatmeal Cookies

This recipe was copied from https://kirbiecravings.com/2-ingredient-banana-oatmeal-cookies/

## Ingredients

- 1 cup quick oats
- 1 large overripe banana

## Tools

- baking sheet with silicone backing mat
- large bowl
- fork

## Method

Preheat oven to 350Â°F. 

Line a baking sheet with silicone baking mat.

In a large bowl, add oats and mashed bananas. 

Mix with a fork until it becomes an evenly mixed, thick batter. 

Make 8 round balls out of the cookie batter. 

Place onto baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart. 

Gently press down on each ball so that it flattens into a round disc. 

Cookies will not spread much during baking, so keep that in mind when shaping and flattening your discs.

Bake for about 15 minutes or until cookies are lightly brown and set. Cookie bottoms should also be brown and easily come off baking sheet.

Let cookies cool before eating. Store uneaten cookies in the fridge.


## Tips

- Please use quick oats because old fashioned and steel-cut oats need more time to cook.
