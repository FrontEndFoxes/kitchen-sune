# Brazilian Chocolate Truffle - Brigadeiro

Probably the most famous and classical brazilian dessert, the brigadeiro is both delicious and easy to make at home.

Since we usually do this without measuring, I based the measures on the [TudoGostoso](https://www.tudogostoso.com.br/receita/114-brigadeiro.html) recipe.

The following recipe makes about 16 truffles, but you sure can (and totally should) eat straight from the pan, just be careful to not burn your mouth.

## Ingredients

- 1 can (395g) condensed milk
- 1/4 cup (30g) cocoa powder
- 1 tablespoon (15g) butter

For coating:
- Chocolate sprinkles

## Tools

- A pan (medium saucepan)
- A wood spoon
- A table spoon
- A plate

## Method

1. Melt the butter on the pan over low heat.

2. Add the condensed milk and the cocoa powder on the pan.

3. Cook, stirring constantly with the wood spoon, until the mixture starts to pull away from the bottom and sides of the pan. This should take about 6-8 minutes. The mixture will get thickier after cooling, so do not overcook.

4. If you're going to eat it from the pan, just let it cool a little bit and then enjoy.

5. For making the truffle balls, remove the mixture from the pan and pour into a greased plate. Let cool for 1 hour.

6. After cooled, grease your hands with butter, take a bit of the mixture with the table spoon and shape into small balls. 

7. Then, roll in topping of your choice. The most traditional are the chocolate sprinkles toppings.

8. Keep refrigerated before serving.

## Tips

The condensed milk is usually already sweet, so be aware of it when choosing the cocoa percentage of the powder. The smaller, the sweetier.
