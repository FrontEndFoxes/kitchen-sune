This is a nice recipe taught by my mother that can be enjoyed with a lot of combinations like rice, Chapati or ugali

## Ingredients
3 kg of meat
A little oil just enough to saute the onions
3 big tomatoes
2 large red onions
4 cloves of garlic
A bit of ginger
Fresh Coriander
Paprika
Beef curry powder
1/2 a teaspoon of msg (optional)
A bit of salt
Rosemary


## Tools

A cooking pot
Large wooden spoon

## Method

Wash your meat and put it in the pot.
Add water to the pot till it covers the meat and let it boil
While the meat is boiling  prep the ingredients, cut the onions and coriander, blend the tomatoes and grate the garlic and ginger
Once all the water from the pot has evaporated add oil to the pot and fry the meat just enough to brown it
Add the chopped onions to the meat and saute till golden brown
Add the ginger and garlic and once the aromatic smell from the garlic comes out start adding your spices plus salt and mix everything together
Add in the blended tomatoes and stir everything together to incoporate it into the meat
Add the coriander and let that simmer for 3 minutes

## Tips

If you feel that the meat is still hard after all the water has evaporated you can add more water and boil it utill it becomes soft
You can always swap out the spices and use the ones you love
