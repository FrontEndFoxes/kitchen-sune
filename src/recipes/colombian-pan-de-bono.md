# Pan de bono

This is a special kind of bread, it was created in Valle de Cauca, Cali with the idea of giving some extra flavor to traditional bread. It's perfect to eat at any time of day and really easy to make.

## Ingredients

- 125gr/1 cup of all purpose flour
- 125gr/1 cup of cassava starch
- 250gr of fresh cheese (queso fresco)
- 1 tablespoon of baking powder
- 2 tablespoons of sugar (brown is preferred, but it can be white sugar)
- 2 tablespoon of butter (it can be salted or unsalted)
- 1 egg
- 60ml or 1/4 cup of milk (any kind of cow milk)


## Tools

- Oven
- Bowl
- Spatula
- Parchment paper
- Baking sheet

## Method

1. Grate the cheese as small as you can and preheat the oven to 220°C or 425°F
2. Get the cassava starch into the bowl and add the cheese. Mix both ingredients with your hands.
3. Add sugar, butter and the egg until all is well mixed and you get a texture similar to sand.
4. Add the milk little by little and continue mixing until you get a dough thats firm and doesn't spread, it also shouldn't stick to your hands.
5. Now you can work the dough spreading it on the table for 5 minutes.
6. Now you can start forming the pan de bonos, get your dough and form balls of the same size, around the size of your palm. 
7. Prepare your baking sheet with parchment paper and spread the dough, they need space because they will grow once in the oven.
8. Bake at 170°C or 338°F for around 20 minutes, you should see a golden color on top. Also check the bottom so they don't burn.
9. Let them chill for a bit, and serve when warm, you can eat them with hot chocolate or coffee. 


## Tips

The most important thing is the cheese, that's what gives it the salty flavor.
