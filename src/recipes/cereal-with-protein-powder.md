# Cereal with Protein Powder

what I enjoy eating mostly every day

## Ingredients

- Cereal of choice ( I like Grape Nuts and a special sprouted cereal called Ezekiel)
- Protein powder, Vanilla or Chocolate (My favorites are Ancient Nutrition Collagen in Chocolate and Amazing Grass in Chocolate Peanut Butter)
- Almond or peanut butter
- Berries (Blueberries, raspberries or blackberries)
- Favorite Nuts (optional)
- Milk of Choice (I mix together an Almond Coconut milk with Organic Grass Fed Whole Milk)

## Tools

- Large Bowl
- Spoon

## Method

- Pour cereal into the bowl, mix 1/2 and 1/2 if using more than one
- Add protein powder (usually 1 scoop)
- Add milk(s)
- Make sure to mix the protein powder in completely... if not you'll end up with powdery bits, which is also sometimes fun
- Add nut butter, nuts, and berries (after washing)
- Enjoy the looks that people give you when they see what you're eating

## Tips

It's ok to go back for more.... it's delicious
