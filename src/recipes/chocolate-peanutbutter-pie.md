# Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie

This is a great alternative to traditional fruit pies. It is luscious, silky smooth, with a great contrast of crunch from the crust. Bonus, there's no "baking" involved!

## Ingredients

Filling:
- 1 ¼ cups smooth peanut butter
- 1 8oz package of cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup powdered sugar, sifted, and divided (¾ cup & ¼ cup)
- 2 tbsp butter, melted
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 1¼ cups 35% whipping cream 
Glaze:
- ⅓ cup 35% whipping cream
- 3 oz semi-sweet chocolate, chopped
Extra:
- Pre-made baked pie crust (my preference is for an Oreo crust)


## Tools

Either a stand-mixer or hand mixer will work well for this recipe. If you have neither, a sturdy wooden spoon will work. You'll also need a large bowl, one or two kitchen spoons and a spatula.

## Method

Beat peanut butter and cream cheese in a large bowl on medium speed of electric mixer until smooth.  Gradually add ¾ cup icing sugar, melted butter & vanilla. Mix well. Beat whipping cream & remaining ¼ cup icing sugar until stiff peaks form. With a spatula, stir one-third of the whipped cream into peanut butter mixture and mix thoroughly. Fold in remaining cream gently, but thoroughly.  Using the spatula, pour the filling from the bowl into your prepared crust.  Chill for 1 hour or until firm.
Bring cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over low heat.  Remove from heat, add chocolate, stirring until melted and smooth.  Cool slightly (about 15 minutes).  Pour over chilled filling, tilting pie to cover top completely. Chill for another hour or overnight to set glaze.


## Tips

Cooking is all about mise-en-place, French for everything in its place. This means have all ingredients measured out, your tools & equipment ready to go, and a free spot in the fridge for the finished product before you start. This will make the entire experience more user friendly. 
The hardest part about this recipe is remembering to take your cream cheese out of the fridge to soften (about an hour before you start).
Although you'll probably want to eat the pie as soon as it's made, it turns out best when chilled overnight.
Pro-tip: After pouring the chocolate glaze on the pie, sprinkle some chopped peanuts on top as a crunchy garnish before returning it to the fridge to chill.
