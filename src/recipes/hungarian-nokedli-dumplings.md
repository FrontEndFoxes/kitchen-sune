# Hungarian Nokedli Dumplings

I love how simple this recipe is and with such few ingredients. Being half Hungarian I enjoy incorporating the dished my father and grandparents make me. This dish is best served with Chicken Paprikash or any Hungarian stew!

## Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 3/4 c. water
- 2 c. all-purpose flour
- 1 large pot filled with generously salted boiling water

## Tools

- large pot
- grater (or nokedli / spaetzel maker)
- colander / slotted spoon

## Method

Place large pot filled with salted water and bring to boil.
Combine eggs, salt, and water, beating well with whisk.

Add flour, a little at a time.

Add only enough flour to make a soft, sticky dough.

Let mixture rest for about 10 mins.

Beat mixture again.

Using the side of a teaspoon, spoon small amount of dough into boiling water.

Dipping the spoon in the hot water will remove the dough from the spoon (if you have a spaetzel maker, that makes is easier as you want very small noodles).

The noodles are done when they float to the top.

Remove from water with large slotted spoon, and place in colander.

Rinse with cold water.

## Tips

You may want to make the dumplings in 2 or 3 batches so they dont overcook.The dumplings are also nice added to a stew.
You can heat the dumplings in a frying pan with melted butter.
Do not let the dumplings get too brown or crisp.
