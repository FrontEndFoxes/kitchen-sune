# Roasted Brussels Sprouts

I love roasted Brussels, but the fresh ones can be expensive, and they tend to dry out when you roast them. The secret? Use frozen Brussels sprouts. The ice crystals trapped in the leaves during the freezing process will lightly steam them from the inside, so they stay moist while the outside takes on that delicious roasty crust.

## Ingredients

One 10oz box of frozen Brussels sprouts (do NOT thaw)
2-3 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil (the exact amount doesn’t matter - just eyeball it)
1/2 tsp garlic powder (or a lot more to taste)
Salt to taste (if you like fancy sea salt this is a good place to use it)

## Tools

Mixing bowl
Foil-lined baking sheet

## Method

Preheat the oven to 425F. Toss the Brussels sprouts, still frozen, with the olive oil and garlic powder, until they are evenly coated. Place in a single layer in a foil-lined baking dish and roast, turning once or twice, until heated through and nicely browned on at least one side (usually the bottom), usually 35-45 minutes. Salt to taste.

## Tips

This will also work at any temperature from 350-450, so you can cook them alongside a chicken or casserole. If you go below 400, turn up the heat for the last 5 or 10 minutes to make sure they brown. At 450, you may want to cover them with foil for the first half of the cooking time so they don’t scorch.

You don’t have to line your baking dish with foil, but it makes clean-up easier.

These reheat beautifully, so you can make them ahead of time. Cook them until they just start to brown, then give them another 10ish minutes in the oven to heat through and brown. (That’s what I do for Thanksgiving!)
