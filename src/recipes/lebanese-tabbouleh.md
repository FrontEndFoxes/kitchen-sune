# Lebanese Tabbouleh

There are a lot of variations of tabbouleh out there—some mostly made of bulgur, some without cucumbers, some with spice—but I always compare those variations to my mother's recipe, and they never stack up. Her recipe has the perfect parsley to bulgur ratio. It has enough lemon to keep it dressed but not soggy. And it has crispy cucumbers that add a nice contrasting bite. She learned how to make tabbouleh from my grandmother, who never used a written recipe, making it each time to taste just the way she liked, as grandmothers usually do. It's the perfect simple summer salad to keep your menu light and fresh. Enjoy.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup fine bulgur (sometimes called #1)
- 2 bunches curly parsley
- 12 large mint leaves
- 1/2 English cucumber
- 5 scallions
- 3 medium tomatoes
- 2 lemons, juiced (about 6 tablespoons)
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 pinch salt and pepper, plus more to taste

## Tools

- Large Bowl
- Knife
- Cutting board

## Method

Directions
Put the bulgur in a bowl, cover it with an inch of just-boiled water, and let it sit at least 20 minutes. (It will double in size.)

Wash and dry the parsley and mint. Remove the stems, finely chop the herbs together, and put them in a large mixing bowl.

Peel and deseed the cucumber half. Slice it lengthwise into thirds, then chop. Chop the scallions and tomatoes and add them to the cucumber, parsley, and mint.

Drain any remaining water out of the bulgur and add it to the vegetables.

Add the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper to the salad. Mix well, taste, and adjust the seasoning and olive oil as needed.
