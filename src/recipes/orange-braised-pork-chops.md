My grandmother would often make these when we came to visit. She shared this recipe with me when I got married so that my husband and I could learn to make it together.

## Ingredients

- 6 loin pork chops, 1 inch thick
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 tablespoon of orange zest
- 1 cup orange juice
- 1 cup orange sections

## Tools

- Large skillet
- Mixing bowl
- Mixing spoon
- Measuring cup
- Measuring spoons

## Method

1. Mix flour and salt together in a small bowl.
2. Wipe pork chops with a damp paper towel and then coat with flour and salt mixture.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet and then brown each side. 3-4 minutes per side.
4. Combine remaining ingredients expect the orange sections.
5. Reduce heat and pour mixture over pork chops. Simmer 45 minutes until tender.

## Tips

Keep an eye on pork as it cooks, thinner pork chops will cook faster. My grandma always used bone-in pork chops.
