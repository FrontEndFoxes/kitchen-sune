# Holdacska_Little Moon Biscuits

This recipe is my son's and my father's favourite and an essential part of the Christmas menu in our family. The recipe is from my grandmother and you can never bake enough of this.  

## Ingredients

28 dekagram of butter (0.62 lbs)
42 dekagram of flour (0.93 lbs)
14 dekagram of finely ground walnuts (0.3 lbs)
14 dekagram of powdered sugar (0.3 lbs)

powdered sugar and vanilla for sprinkle



## Tools

oven
table
bowl
baking tray

## Method

After mixing the dry ingredients knead it with the cold butter 
(adding in small pieces). If it is done put it in the refrigerator
for half an our or more (can stay during the whole night).
Take out as much as you can work with (so you can prevent the remaining 
dough of warming up), and roll out the dough (3-5mm thick). Bake it until 
it gets some light colour (180 celsius 8-9 minutes). 
Prepare a box or a small bowl and fill it with a cup of powdered sugar and mix it with the
vanilla extract as you like it. When you take out the hot biscuits from the oven 
roll them in the sugar while they are warm so they can drink in the 
essence of vanilla. 


## Tips

Keep the dough cold when you are not working with it. 
Use a hint of flour under the dough when rolling it out.
