# Strawberry Mush

When I was a child, my Mom would make this simple desert for me.

As an adult, I still enjoy this treat very much.

## Ingredients

- 1 packet of Strawberries
- 3/4 cup Milk (1% or 2%)
- 1/4 cup Sugar

## Method

- Place the strawberries in a decently sized bowl
- Mash the strawberries with a potato masher
- Mix in milk gradually, stirring occasionally
- Gradually add in sugar while stirring the mixture

## Tips

My mom did not really have a specific amount for each ingredient, so this is roughly what I have been using to make the dessert. Feel free to adjust the ingredient measurements to what suits you!
