# Menemen

I love eating menemen at the breakfast. It is easy to cook and so yummy. You can eat menemen with bread. 

## Ingredients 

- 3 eggs

- Oil

- 1 Onion

- 2 Green Pepper

- A cup of kashar cheese 

- Salt


## Tools

- grater for cheese and tomatoes

## Method

Grate tomatoes and kashar cheese. 

Sauté the onion and peppers with oil.

Then, add tomatoes and salt.

Stir for a bit until the tomatoes are nice and hot.

Add the scrambled eggs and let them cook. 

Then mix them up. After a couple of minutes, add kashar cheese and close the cover of pan. 

After two minutes, open the cover and enjoy your menemen :)
