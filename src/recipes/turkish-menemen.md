## Method

Grate tomatoes and kashar cheese. 

Sauté the onion and peppers with oil.

Then, add tomatoes and salt.

Stir for a bit until the tomatoes are nice and hot.

Add the scrambled eggs and let them cook. 

Then mix them up. After a couple of minutes, add kashar cheese and close the cover of pan.
