# Brazilian Chicken Strogonoff

Strogonoff is a Russian dish, but us brazilians have our own way to make some dish more...well...authorial (please, ask us about Pizzaria Batepapo)


## Ingredients

- 500g of chicken breast
- 1 onion
- 1 garlic clove (or more! You call it)
- 200g of milk cream
- 1 teaspoon of ketchup
- 1 teaspoon of yellow mustard
- 200g of tomato sauce
- 1 teaspoon of sunflower oil
- 1 pinch of salt and pepper


## Tools

- Pan
- Knife to cut your food
- Spoon to mix


## Method

We start by cutting the chicken breast in little cubes (about the size of a finger). 
Our veggies too, cut the onion in small cubes and our garlic in even small pieces.
Put the oil in the pan and saute our veggies, when the onion became a beautiful golden color, let's put the chicken breast and season it with salt and pepper.
When the chicken breast is nicely cooked we put the liquids, I recommend this order: mick cream, tomato sauce, ketchup and finally the mustard.
Mix everything very well, taste to see if it needs more salt, and if it's tasteful, that's done!

## Tips

I am a garlic lover so I always use 3 ou 4 garlic cloves. Also, I love the smell of oregano, so, if you have some, don't be shy and put a pinch in your pan with the chicken!
This dish is perfect with some white rice and french fries.
