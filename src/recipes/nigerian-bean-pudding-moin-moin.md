# Nigerian Bean Pudding Moin-Moin

Bean Pudding is a traditionally steamed western Nigeria delicacy which is made from a mixture of washed and peeled black-eyed peas or brown beans. It is rich in protein and fibre.


## Ingredients

- 2-3 cups of brown beans or black-eyed beans
- 3 Red Bell Pepper (to add colour)
- 4 chili pepper
- 2 medium onions
- 2 cooking spoons vegetable oil
- Salt (to taste)
- 1 tablespoon ground crayfish
- 2 stock cubes
- 6 Hard-boiled Eggs
- 1 Mackerel or Salmon Fish
- warm water  (for grinding and mixing)

## Tools

- Wide Cooking pot 
- Knife
- Cooking spoon
- Blender
- Thaumatococcus daniellii or Container 

## Method

Soak the beans in water, scrub and peel the outer covering to get a clean white beans.

Wash the pepper and onions, add to the clean beans and blend with blender to get a smooth mixture.

Pour the beans mixture in a bowl, add sliced onions, salt, boiled fish without the bone, seasoning cubes, vegetable oil, appropriate warm water and stir together. 

Place a wide cooking pot on medium heat, line the base of the pot with sticks from the Thaumatococcus daniellii, add small quantity of water and heat for 2 minutes.

Pour the mixture one after the other into a folded Thaumatococcus daniellii and place the boiled egg inside. 

Carefully place and arrange the wrapped mixture inside the pot. Add enough water to the pot (Add enough water that will not submerge the wrapped mixture). The water is to prevent the bean pudding from sticking to the base of the pot.

Cover the pot tightly and allow the mixture to steam for 45 minutes. Check it from time to time to ensure there is water inside the pot.

To check for doneness, insert a toothpick into the middle of the Moin Moin. The toothpick should come out fairly clean and not wet.

Turn off the heat and leave to cool for at least five minutes before serving.

## Tips

Bean Pudding can be served with pap, custard, rice and bread.
