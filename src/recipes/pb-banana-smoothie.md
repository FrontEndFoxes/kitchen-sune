# Peanut Butter & Banana Milkshake

The combination of peanut butter and banana is beautiful, especially in milkshake form. It's really easy to make and very yummy too!

## Ingredients

- 2 bananas
- peanut butter 
- hemp hearts/seeds
- cinnamon
- oat milk 
- ice

## Tools

- blender

## Method

You can throw these ingredients in the blender in any order, but this is what I end up doing.
1. Pour 1-1.5 cups of oat milk into blender
2. Add two bananas
3. Struggle to add a cup of peanut butter that doesn't want to get off your spoon
4. Add a tablespoon of hemp hearts (gives a nutty flavor + they're supposedly really good for you)
5. Add a dash of cinnamon
6. Don't forget to add a couple of ice cubes (I always do)
7. blend, blend, blend!
8. Pour into a glass and drink up

## Tips

You can use your favorite kind of milk and peanut butter to personalize your milkshake!
