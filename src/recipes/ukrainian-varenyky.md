# Ukrainian Varenyky

Varenyky are traditional Ukrainian dumplings with a variety of fillings from sweet like cherries to sour like Sauerkraut. Each Ukrainian host has an own recipe of varenyky, but the cooking method stays the same: wrapping unleavened dough around the filling. Even Nikolai Gogol wrote about the dish, carrying a useful tip throughout the centuries: don’t forget to serve sour cream and dip varenyky in it before eating.

## Ingredients

**For dough:**

- 1 glass of kefir
- 5 glasses of wheat flour
- 0.5 tsp. of baking soda
- 1 pinch of salt

**For the filling:**

- 8 potatoes
- 2 onions
- 3 tbsp. sunflower oil
- 10 g butter
- 1 pinch of salt
- 0.5 tsp. black ground pepper

## Tools

- Saucepan
- Frying pan
- Knife
- Spatula
- Potato presser or stick mixer
- Rolling pin

## Method

1. Wash and peel the potatoes, wash once again. Cut in large pieces. Put the potatoes in a saucepan and pour it with cold water, add salt and put on medium heat. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook until ready for about 25 minutes.
2. Peel the onion and cut in cubes. Preheat the frying pan with vegetable oil and fry the onion on medium heat until golden for about 5 minutes, occasionally stirring with a spatula.
3. Drain the water from boiled potatoes. Add butter, a third part of the fried onions and blend the potatoes. Add salt, pepper to taste and mix thoroughly with a spoon. Put the filling in a plate and leave to cool off.
4. Pour kefir and soda into a separate bowl, add salt and mix thoroughly. Then add the flour by half a glass each time, carefully mixing with a spoon. Spread the dough on the processing board for kneading and knead until homogeneous. It shouldn't stick to hands.
5. Cut off a 2cm dough strip and cut it into cubes on the processing board. Mash the cubes in flour on both sides and roll out with a rolling pin.
6. Put the potato filling in the middle of the circle of dough and pinch the edges. Put dumplings on a processing board sprinkled with flour, so that they do not stick to the surface. The dough is enough for about 25 varenyky. You can freeze dumplings in a freezer and cook them later.
7. Pour cold water in a saucepan, salt to taste and boil on high heat. Put the dumplings in boiling water, moving them with a spatula so that they do not stick to the bottom of the pan. Leave to cook on medium heat. Remove the heat in 2-3 minutes after the dumplings pop up on the surface. Dry the water, put varenyky in a bowl. Mix with the rest of the fried onion. Serve hot with sour cream.

## Tips

There's hardly a more iconic Ukrainian dish than varenyky with potatoes. The most important part of the recipe is preparing the dough. Don't worry if varenyky don't come out picture-perfect at the first attempt - usually, it takes years of practice. Make sure kefir is room temperature before following the recipe.
