# Dalgona Coffee

Dalgona Coffee is from South Korea and became one of the most trended recipes during the pandemic time. The coffee mixture is whipped or beaten to an extent of getting a foamy, smooth, creamy consistency much like whipped cream. Yes this coffee cream is a bomb full of flavors of coffee and only coffee.

## Ingredients

- tablespoon instant coffee
- tablespoons hot boiling water
- tablespoons sugar
- 1.5 cups milk (at room temperature or chilled)
- Ice cubes - as required, optional
- Cocoa powder - optional

## Tools

A coffee whisker

## Method

1. In a small to medium sized mixing bowl, take 1 tablespoon instant coffee and 3 tablespoons sugar.
2. Pour 2 tablespoons of hot boiling water.
3. Mix and then begin to beat the coffee.
4. Use two ways of beating the coffee. First beat clockwise and then use vertical zig-zag motions. Alternate between the two. If the bowl is small, then slightly tilt the bowl and beat.
5. Beat it for total of 8-10 minutes. You will see that the color has also lightened and it will get foamy whipped consistency.
6. Take 2 to 3 ice cubes (optional) in two mugs or glasses. Divide 1.5 milk between both the glasses. Ice cubes can be skipped if you use chilled cold milk.
7. Spoon the creamy whipped coffee on top.
8.  Sprinkle some cocoa powder on top (optional). Serve. Stir and then sip. Enjoy !

## Tips

For a quicker option, add the coffee, hot water and sugar in a small mixer-grinder or a small blender jar. Blend till you get a creamy consistency.
