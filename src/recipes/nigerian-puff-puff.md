# Nigerian Puff Puff

Nigerian Puff puff is a delicious deep-fried  street snack that is sweet, spongy, and a total crowd-pleaser. It’s similar to buns but lighter and smooth. It is a simple and easy snacks to prepare.

## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon instant yeast
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup powdered milk, optional
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder
- 2 cups warm water
- Oil for deep frying

## Tools

- Bowl
- Deep Frying Pan
- Rounded Tablespoon 
- Mixing Spoon

## Method

Add the dry ingredients except for the salt into a big bowl.

Mix the dry ingredients, add the warm water and salt and mix until smooth and lump-free. 

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and/or kitchen napkin and leave in a warm spot until the batter is well formed.(For about 40 minutes).

Deflate batter and give it a very good mix (pulling the dough towards you), then heat up some oil for deep frying.

You will notice the change in texture after about 5 minutes and it would continue to rise.

Test to make sure the oil is hot enough by dropping a teaspoon of batter into it. If batter flows to the top then it’s fine. If it browns too quickly, oil is too hot, take off the heat and cool for a minute. 

Using a rounded tablespoon or your hand, drop batter into hot oil and fry till bottom is golden brown, turn balls over and fry till it’s golden brown all over.

Using a slotted spoon, take out Puff Puff and place on paper napkins to soak up excess oil. Continue the process till you use up all the batter.

## Tips

Puff Puff is best enjoyed hot and it can be served with any beverage or drink of your choice.
