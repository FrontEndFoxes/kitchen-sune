# Healthy Granola

This is a favorite recipe in my home. My kids and I love to eat it with milk or over yogurt. It's perfectly sweet and full of healthy stuff!

## Ingredients

- 2 cups rolled oats
- 1/2 cup shredded coconut (unsweetened)
- 1 cup almonds, chopped (or hazelnuts, pecans, walnuts)
- 1/2 cup flaxseed, ground
- 4 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1/3 cup coconut oil, melted
- 2/3 cup dried cherries (or cranberries, raisins)

## Tools

- Large bar pan
- Spatula
- Mixing bowl

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 300 F / 150 C degrees. Line a bar pan with parchment paper and set aside.

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients: oats, shredded coconut, nuts, cinnamon and salt.

1. Add the wet ingredients: maple syrup and coconut oil. Mix thoroughly until well combined and all the oats look wet.

1. Transfer to prepared bar pan, spread the mixture into a 3/4"-thick layer (about 1.5/2 cm) and with a spatula, press down the granola on the prepared baking sheet.

1. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown. (All ovens are different so start checking around 20-25 minutes.)

1. Remove from the oven, spread the dried fruits on top and let it cool completely.

1. DO NOT TOUCH the granola until cool.

1. Break it into pieces and store in an air-tight container â€“ ideally in the fridge to keep it extra crunchy.

## Tips

> If you prefer your granola without clusters, spread the mixture as much as possible and don't press it down.
> I use a silicone baking sheet which makes it easier to break the granola into clusters by lifting and bending the silicone sheet.
