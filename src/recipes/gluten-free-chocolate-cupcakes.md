# Gluten Free Chocolate Cupcakes

If you're avoiding gluten, (could be because of a diet, or just because you have Celiac's Disease) we can all agree that it's hard to find good tasting gluten free recipes, i know, i know! But trust me when i say this recipe has nothing to envy from those with wheat flour (it personally tastes better). So let's dive right into it. 


## Ingredients

For this recipe you'll need:

- 1/2 spoon of coconut oil (warmed so that it's liquid)
- 1/2 cup of peanut butter (you can skip it if you want)
- 3 spoons of sweetener 
- 4 eggs
- 1 spoon of vanilla essence
- 1/2 spoon of gluten free baking powder
- 2/4 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips 
- 3/4 cups of almond flour
- 2/4 cups of cocoa powder

## Tools

- Mixing bowl
- Whisker or spoon / fork to mix
- Cupcake mould  

## Method

Put the coconut oil, peanut butter and one egg in a bowl to mix.
Add the eggs one by one and keep mixing.
Add the vanilla essence, the sweetener, baking powder and the almond flour.
Mix them together and add the cocoa powder.
Once all the ingredients have a uniform consistency., add the chocolate chips and mix once more. 

Now pour the batter into the cupcake mould, remember to leave some space for it to grow on the top!

Take to oven for 20mins at 375°F.


## Tips

You can take this recipe and make it yours! Don't worry about it, some modifications and tips you might like are: 

- Melting the chocolate chips before adding them.
- Changing the peanut butter for other ingredients you might like more (like nutella).
- Instead of using almond flour use regular(wheat) flour.

Don't limit yourself! In the kitchen possibilities are endless :)
