# Maple Walnut Cranberry Relish

I make this relish every fall for our Thanksgiving dinner, celebrated in the US on the 3rd Thursday in November. It's a little sweet and little tart and, according to my family, so much better than the canned stuff.

Thanks to [Chef John 👨‍🍳 at AllRecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/235618/maple-walnut-cranberry-relish/) for the inspiration.

## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries, rinsed and drained
- 3/4 cup orange juice (optional: with pulp)
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 3/4 cup chopped walnuts

## Tools

- measuring cups
- tablespoon measure
- relishpan
- cooking spoon
- **optional**: small skillet and colander
- serving bowl with cover or a storage container/jar

## Method

1. Place cranberries into a large relishpan and stir in orange juice, maple syrup, sugar, ginger, orange zest, and cinnamon stick.
2. Bring relish to a simmer. Berries will begin to pop. Cook at a simmer until berries are cooked through and soft, about 10 minutes.
3. **Optional**: While the relish is cooking, stir the walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat about 5-10 minutes. This should help the skins release from the nut meat. Then, vigorously shake the walnuts in a colander to remove most of the bitter outer skin.
4. Remove the relishpan from heat and let cranberry relish cool for about 5 minutes.
5. Stir the walnuts into cranberry relish. Let it cool to room temperature and transfer it to a serving bowl or storage container. The relish will thicken as it cools.
6. Refrigerate until needed. For best results, give the relish a few days before serving.

## Tips

I like to find a decorative jar to store my relish. It comes out of the refigerator and gets put on the table for a nice festive addition.

Since the relish lasts for several weeks, we often use the extras with breakfast toast. It can also be used as a dessert topping on vanilla ice cream.
