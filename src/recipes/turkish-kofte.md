# Kofte

Kofte is a popular meatball type of dish in Turkey and the middle east. We have many kofta recipes and kebabs in Turkish cuisine.

## Ingredients

- 500gr. ground meat (you can use 30% lamb if you like and preferably at least 20% fat)
- 2 medium-size onions
- 4 tbsp ground stale bread/bread crumbs
- a big handful of parsley (optional)
- 1 tsp each black pepper, salt, paprika
- 1/4 tsp baking soda (optional) – you can add 3-4 drops of lemon juice over the baking soda before you add it.

## To serve: 

- 1-2 big firm tomatoes
- 6-8 green sweet peppers
- olive oil to brush the griddle or pan

## Tools

- griddle or pan
- grater

## Method

- In a food processor add onion cut in four, parsley. If you are using stale bread soak it in water to soften then squeeze out excess water and add to the onion parsley mixture. Process until they have fine pieces, avoid over-processing, and don’t make it like a purée.

- Add the ground meat, spices, and baking soda if using. Drop 3-4 drops of lemon juice over the baking soda and mix everything by pulsing until is it evenly incorporated.

- Dip your hand into the water from time to time and get smaller than mandarine size mixture and first shape into a ball and press it to make a disk. It comes together when cooks and becomes thicker so consider that while shaping.

- Heat the cast iron griddle or non-stick frying pan or grill. Brush it with vegetable oil.

## Tips

Add kofte pieces leaving space between them and cook on medium heat until both sides and inside are fully cooked.
