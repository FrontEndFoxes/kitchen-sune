# Egg Noodles

As a student who barely has time to prepare meals, egg and noodle is my go-to meal. Asides being a "fastfood" as we call it in Nigeria, it is also healthy when prepared appropriately. It can also be prepared differently by different people, this is my own unique and yummy way of preparing egg noodles.

- 2 eggs
- 1 sliced onion
- chopped spring onions
- 2 sliced Scotch Bonnet Chile Peppers
- Noodle seasoning powder
- 2 table spoon groundnut oil
- 3 grated carrots
- 2 pinches ginger powder
- 1 pinch salt


## Tools

- Medium sized cooking pot
- Spoon
- Knife
- Chopping board
- Bowl plate

## Method
Par-boil the noodles and drain out the water: You start the meal by boiling a pot of water on a medium flame and placing the noodles in the pot of boiled water. 

After boiling the noodles for sometime, drain it out from the pot and place in a sieve.

Heat a pan of oil over the medium heat, once the oil is sufficiently hot, add the sliced onions, the noodle seasoning powder, the chopped spring onions, the sliced scotch Bonnet Chile peppers, the ginger powder, the grated carrots and stir-fry for sometime.

Break the eggs in a bowl, add a pinch of salt and fry in the oil.

Add the boiled noodles and stir till it permeates through it. 

Leave for just one minute.

Transfer to a serving bowl and serve hot.
