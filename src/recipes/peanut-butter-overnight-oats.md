# Peanut Butter Overnight Oats

This is an easy, cheap, and delicious make-ahead recipe - you won't have any excuse not to eat breakfast! It's also great for hot weather when you're in the mood for oatmeal but don't want to cook it on the stove.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup almond milk
- 1/2 Tbsp chia seeds
- 1 Tbsp flaxseed meal
- 1/2 Tbsp maple syrup
- 1 Tbsp peanut butter
- 1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- optional toppings

## Tools

- Bowl
- Spoon

## Method

In a bowl add the milk, chia seeds, flaxseed meal, maple syrup, peanut butter, and oats.

Stir well to combine. If the oats are not fully submerged in liquid, add a little more milk and re-stir. 

Add the cinnamon on top and cover or seal and refrigerate overnight.

Stir the oats before serving and add toppings as desired. Enjoy cold or heat to desired temperature.

## Tips

This recipe is highly customizable - you can adjust the ingredients to your preference, make substitutes such as oat milk or cashew butter, and add whatever toppings you choose!

My favorite toppings are peanuts and a spoonful of mini chocolate chips for a salty and sweet crunch. I also recommend making this in a mason jar if you need a breakfast on the go!
