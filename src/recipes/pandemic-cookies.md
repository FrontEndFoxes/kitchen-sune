# Pandemic cookies

I tried the usual pandemic recipes with varying success.

Sourdough bread (total failure, like a doorstop)\
Carbonara noodles (big success)\
New York Times fancy Tomato sandwich (Best thing I've discovered in years)\

Elderberry syrup (never used, still in fridge)\
David Chang's Momofuku Bossam - I did something wrong, like eating a block of salt.

These lazy chocolate chip cookies became a Friday night (then Monday, Wednesday, Saturday) staple.
They helped my family find a little joy in the last year (or so).

## Ingredients

1 package of cookie dough.

## Tools

Oven or toaster oven\
Cookie Sheet\
Parchment Paper (optional)

## Method

Preheat oven to 350 and place dough squares on parchment paper lined cookie sheet. 
Cook for 13-14 min.

## Tips

Eat immediately while cookies are still warm, while binge watching anything Marvel, Community, Parks and Rec, Shadow and Bone, His Dark Materials, 30 Rock or the Flash.
